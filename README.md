This repository is dedicated to the Master's thesis "Cross-Sensor Transfer Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification Using HYPSO-1 and PRISMA". 

The Faubai folder contains the notebooks regarding preprocessing, training and evaluation of the Faubai dataset (PRISMA).

The HYPSO_TreeLabels folder contains the notebooks regarding preprocessing, training and evaluation of the HYPSO-TreeLabels dataset (HYPSO-1).

Finally, all models used in this experiment can be found in the "models" notebook, and the creation of the projection matrix between HYPSO-1 and PRISMA in the "projection_matrix" notebook.


The data resources used in these notebooks must be requested. Contact the HYPSO team at NTNU Small Satellite Lab (https://www.ntnu.edu/smallsat) or the author of this repository for access.
